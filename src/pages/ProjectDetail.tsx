    "Prototype #3: This is an upgraded version of our 2nd prototype where we incorporated larger wheels, a netting system for a payload, and a foldable handle to move the cart. The focus of this prototype was to demonstrate the wheel system over larger obstacles.",
    "CAD Model of Prototype #4: This CAD model shows the direction we wanted to move the project towards. It highlights a lower and longer chassis which lowers the center of gravity as well as allows for longer payloads.",
    "Prototype #4: This is our manufactured prototype where the frame is made out of 6061 T6 Aluminum, providing enough strength to carry 200 lbs.",
    "Prototype #5: This prototype is nearing our end product where it labels all of the components we've integrated.",
    "CAD Model of Final Product: This CAD model shows all the updates we want to incorporate into our final design and allowed us to conduct an FEA test to ensure correct material selection."
